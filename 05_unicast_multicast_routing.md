**Unicast Routing** is the process of sending data from a single source to a single destination across a network. In this method, data is transmitted one-to-one, meaning the sender sends the data to only one recipient.

**Multicast Routing** is the process of sending data from a single source to multiple specific destinations simultaneously. It allows data to be transmitted from one sender to a group of receivers, rather than sending separate copies to each recipient.
