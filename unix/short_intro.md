Here's a **very short and exam-oriented** summary of the key UNIX concepts:

---

### 💻 **UNIX Operating System**

A **multiuser**, **multitasking**, and **portable** operating system, widely used in servers and programming environments.

---

### 🧱 **UNIX Architecture**

1. **Kernel** – Core of UNIX

   * Manages hardware, memory, processes, files, and system calls

2. **Shell** – Command-line interface

   * Accepts user input and passes it to the kernel

3. **Utilities** – Standard programs/tools (e.g., `ls`, `cp`)

---

### 📁 **Files and Processes**

* **Everything in UNIX is a file** (including devices).
* **Process** – A running program.
* Commands like `ps`, `kill`, and `top` manage processes.

---

### 🧩 **System Calls**

* Interface between **user programs and kernel**
* Examples: `read()`, `write()`, `fork()`, `exec()`, `open()`

---

### ⭐ **Features of UNIX**

* Multiuser & multitasking
* Portability
* Security & permission control
* Pipelining and redirection
* Rich set of utilities

---

### 📜 **POSIX and SUS**

* **POSIX**: Portable Operating System Interface

  * IEEE standard for UNIX compatibility
* **SUS**: Single UNIX Specification

  * Defines what it means to be a "UNIX" system

---

### 🛠️ **Internal vs External Commands**

| Internal Commands        | External Commands           |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Built into shell         | Stored as separate binaries |
| Fast execution           | Slower (loads from disk)    |
| e.g. `cd`, `echo`, `pwd` | e.g. `ls`, `cp`, `grep`     |
