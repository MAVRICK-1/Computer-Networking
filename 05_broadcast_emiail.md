**Electronic Mail (Email)** is a way of sending messages or files through the internet from one person to another. It allows you to send text, images, documents, and other files to someone else using their email address. Emails are sent from your email client (like Gmail or Outlook) to an email server, which then delivers them to the recipient's email client.

### Protocols used in Email:

1. **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**:
   - It's like the postal service for emails. SMTP is used to **send** emails from your email client to the server or from one server to another. It's responsible for making sure your email gets delivered to the correct destination.

2. **POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3)**:
   - POP3 is used to **retrieve** your emails from the server to your email client. It downloads the emails to your device and usually deletes them from the server, meaning they are stored only on your device.

3. **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)**:
   - IMAP is another protocol used to **retrieve** emails from the server. Unlike POP3, IMAP allows you to keep your emails on the server, so you can access them from multiple devices (like your phone, tablet, or computer) and keep them in sync.

4. **MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)**:
   - MIME is a set of rules that allows you to send things like images, videos, and files (such as PDFs or Word documents) in an email. It works with SMTP to help send and receive emails with attachments or rich content.
  
**Broadcast** refers to sending data from one source to all devices or systems in a network. In this method, the data is sent to every recipient within the network without a specific destination in mind, similar to broadcasting a signal to an entire area.
