### üìò **Easy Definitions (with a little more explanation)**

1. **Population**
   The **whole group** you want to learn about.
   Example: If you‚Äôre studying how much students study, the population could be **all the students in your country**.

2. **Sample**
   A **smaller group** chosen from the population to study.
   Example: You ask **100 students** from different schools ‚Äî that‚Äôs your sample.

3. **Statistical Inference**
   Using the **sample data** to make smart **guesses about the population**.
   You don‚Äôt need to ask everyone ‚Äî just a sample, and then use math to estimate things for the full group.

4. **Statistical Modeling**
   Creating a **mathematical formula or rule** that describes your data.
   Example: ‚ÄúThe more you study, the better your marks‚Äù ‚Äî you make a model (like a line or curve) to show this.

5. **Probability Distribution**
   A way to show **how likely** different results are.
   Example: In a fair dice, each number (1 to 6) has a **1 in 6** chance. That‚Äôs a simple probability distribution.

6. **Fitting a Model**
   Checking how well your model **matches the real data**.
   If your formula fits well, it can be used to make predictions or explain patterns.

7. **R (Intro to R)**
   **R is a programming language** used by data scientists.
   It helps you do **math, graphs, and data analysis** quickly and easily.
   You can use it to **build models, check results, and visualize data**.
