### Advanced Internet Technology

#### **1. Internet Telephony (VoIP)**  
**Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)** enables voice communication over the internet instead of traditional telephone networks.  

- **Key Features**:  
  - Cost-effective communication.
  - Uses protocols like SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) and H.323 for call signaling.  
  - Requires codecs for audio compression (e.g., G.711, G.729).  
- **Applications**: Skype, Zoom, WhatsApp voice calls.

#### **2. Multimedia Applications**  
Multimedia applications involve integrating text, images, video, and audio to create interactive experiences.  
- Examples: Video conferencing, online gaming, video streaming, and e-learning.  
- Requirements:  
  - High bandwidth.  
  - Real-time delivery protocols like RTP (Real-Time Protocol).

#### **3. Multimedia over IP**  
Protocols enabling multimedia communication over IP networks:  

- **RSVP (Resource Reservation Protocol)**:  
  - Reserves network resources to ensure QoS (Quality of Service).  
  - Ensures bandwidth and latency for multimedia.  

- **RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol)**:  
  - Transmits real-time audio and video data.  
  - Provides timestamps and sequence numbers for synchronization.  

- **RTCP (RTP Control Protocol)**:  
  - Works alongside RTP to monitor data delivery.  
  - Provides feedback on quality (e.g., packet loss, jitter).  

- **RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol)**:  
  - Controls the delivery of streaming media.  
  - Functions: Play, Pause, and Seek in video/audio streams.

#### **4. Streaming Media**  
Streaming media allows real-time delivery of audio and video without downloading the full file.  

- **Live Streaming**: Broadcasts events in real-time (e.g., YouTube Live, Twitch).  
- **On-Demand Streaming**: Users access media at any time (e.g., Netflix, Spotify).

#### **5. Codec and Plugins**  
- **Codecs (Compressor-Decompressor)**:  
  - Compress multimedia data for transmission and decompress it for playback.  
  - Examples: H.264, H.265, MP3, AAC.  

- **Plugins**:  
  - Software components that add functionalities to web browsers or applications.  
  - Examples: Adobe Flash, QuickTime, VLC browser plugins.

#### **6. IPTV (Internet Protocol Television)**  
**IPTV** delivers TV content over IP networks instead of traditional cable or satellite systems.  

- **Types of IPTV**:  
  - Live TV: Streaming live broadcasts.  
  - Video-on-Demand (VoD): Accessing media libraries.  
  - Time-shifted TV: Watching past broadcasts.  

- **Advantages**:  
  - Interactive services.  
  - Higher quality video.

#### **8. Metadata**  
**Metadata** is data about data, providing information about a file or resource.  

- **Types**:  
  - Descriptive: Information about content (title, author).  
  - Structural: Relationships within the data (e.g., chapters in a book).  
  - Administrative: Technical details (file type, creation date).  

- **Use Cases**:  
  - Improving searchability.  
  - Organizing multimedia libraries.  
  - Enhancing SEO.
