### Cloud Computing Definition in Simple Words

Cloud computing is a way to use computer services like storage, software, and processing power over the internet instead of on your own computer. It's like renting access to technology rather than owning it.

### Basics of Cloud Computing

1. **Defining a Cloud**:  
   A "cloud" refers to a network of servers on the internet that store and manage data, run applications, and deliver services.

2. **Cloud Types**:  
   - **NIST Model**: A standard model that explains cloud services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and deployment types.  
   - **Cloud Cube Model**: Focuses on data security and divides cloud environments based on internal/external and owner/outsourced control.  
   - **Deployment Models**:  
     - **Public Cloud**: Shared resources available to everyone (e.g., Google Drive).  
     - **Private Cloud**: Dedicated to a single organization (e.g., company-specific servers).  
     - **Hybrid Cloud**: A mix of public and private clouds (e.g., a company using both AWS and private storage).  
     - **Community Cloud**: Shared by a group of organizations with similar needs (e.g., government clouds).

3. **Service Models**:  
   - **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Renting hardware resources like virtual machines (e.g., AWS EC2).  
   - **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Tools and platforms for building applications (e.g., Google App Engine).  
   - **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Software accessed online (e.g., Gmail, Dropbox).

4. **Cloud Reference Model**:  
   This model explains how cloud components interact, such as users, platforms, and applications.

### Characteristics of Cloud Computing

- **On-demand Access**: Use services whenever needed.  
- **Scalability**: Increase or decrease resources easily.  
- **Cost-effectiveness**: Pay only for what you use.  
- **Accessibility**: Access from anywhere with the internet.  
- **A Paradigm Shift**: Moves from owning hardware to using shared online services.

### Cloud Architecture (Overview)

1. **Composability**: Building complex applications by combining simpler cloud services.  
2. **Infrastructure**: Virtual servers, storage, and networking.  
3. **Platforms**: Development tools and environments in the cloud.  
4. **Virtual Appliances**: Pre-configured virtual machines for specific tasks.  
5. **Communication Protocols**: Standards for devices to connect with the cloud.  
6. **Applications**: Software running on cloud platforms.

### Services and Applications

1. **IaaS**:  
   - Provides basic virtual machines, storage, and networks.  
   - Examples: AWS EC2, Microsoft Azure VM.  
   - Concepts: Virtual private servers, silos, and workloads.

2. **PaaS**:  
   - Offers tools for app development.  
   - Examples: Heroku, Google App Engine.

3. **SaaS**:  
   - Ready-to-use software accessed online.  
   - Examples: Microsoft 365, Salesforce.

4. **IDaaS (Identity as a Service)**: Manages digital identities (e.g., Okta, Azure AD).  
5. **CaaS (Compliance as a Service)**: Ensures data and process compliance with regulations.
