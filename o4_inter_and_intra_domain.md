**Intra-domain routing** refers to the process of directing data within a single network or domain. It ensures that data travels from one point to another within the same organization or network.

**Inter-domain routing** refers to the process of directing data between different networks or domains. It ensures that data travels from one network to another, connecting different organizations or the internet.


### **Differences Between Intra-Domain and Inter-Domain Routing**

| Feature               | Intra-Domain Routing                                      | Inter-Domain Routing                                      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | Routing within a single network or organization (AS).    | Routing between different networks or organizations (ASes). |
| **Scope**             | Within a single AS                                        | Between multiple ASes                                     |
| **Administrative Control** | Managed by one organization or entity                  | Managed by multiple organizations or entities             |
| **Protocols**         | OSPF, IS-IS, RIP                                          | BGP                                                       |
| **Focus**             | Ensures fast and efficient routing inside the network     | Focuses on policies, peering, and connectivity between networks |
| **Complexity**        | Easier to manage and configure                            | More complex, involves managing policies and routes across networks |
| **Optimization**      | Optimizes for performance and quick updates               | Optimizes for policy compliance, traffic management, and global reach |
| **Scalability**       | Limited to the size of the network (AS)                   | Designed for large-scale, global internet routing          |
