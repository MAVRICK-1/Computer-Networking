### Network Layer Overview

The **Network Layer** handles data transfer between different networks. It ensures data gets to the correct destination by managing addressing, routing, and devices.

#### **Internetworking Devices**  
- **Repeaters**: Boost weak signals to extend the network range.  
- **Hubs**: Connect devices in a network but send data to all devices.  
- **Bridges**: Connect two networks and filter traffic.  
- **Switches**: Direct data to specific devices in a network.  
- **Routers**: Connect different networks and decide the best path for data.  
- **Gateways**: Act as a translator between different network types.  

#### **Addressing**  
- **Internet Address**: Unique identifier for devices on the internet.  
- **Classful Addressing**: Divides IP addresses into classes (A, B, C) based on network size.  

#### **Routing**  
- **Techniques**: Find the best path for data to travel.  
- **Static Routing**: Fixed paths set by admins.  
- **Dynamic Routing**: Paths change automatically based on network conditions.  

#### **Protocols**  
- **IP (Internet Protocol)**: Moves data packets between devices.  
- **IPv6**: Newer version of IP with a larger address space for more devices.
