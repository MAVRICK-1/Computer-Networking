### **Services and Applications**

1. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**  
   - **What is SOA?** A way to design software where different parts (called "services") talk to each other using messages.  
   - **Message-Based Transactions**: Services send and receive messages to complete tasks.  
   - **Protocol Stack**: The rules and formats (like SOAP or REST) used by services to talk to each other.  
   - **Event-Driven SOA**: Services respond automatically when something happens, like a change in data.  
   - **Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)**: A tool that helps connect and manage all the services, like a traffic controller.  
   - **Service Catalogs**: A list of all the services available, like a menu in a restaurant.

2. **Applications in the Cloud**  
   - **Cloud Applications**: Apps that run using the internet, so you don’t need to install them on your computer.  
   - **Cloud Transactions**: Actions (like saving or retrieving data) done in these cloud apps.  
   - **Functionality Mapping**: Deciding which parts of an app should work on the cloud.  
   - **Application Attributes**: Features like being able to grow quickly when more users join or recover fast from failures.  
   - **Cloud Service Attributes**: Characteristics of cloud services, like being available anytime, anywhere.  
   - **System Abstraction**: Hiding the complexity of how the app works behind the scenes.  
   - **Cloud Bursting**: When a private system uses extra resources from the public cloud during high demand.  
   - **Cloud APIs**: Tools to connect apps with cloud services, like a remote control for the cloud.

3. **Cloud-Based Storage**  
   - **What is it?** Storing your files on the internet instead of your computer.  
   - **Manned Storage**: You upload or manage files manually (e.g., uploading photos to Google Drive).  
   - **Unmanned Storage**: Files are stored or updated automatically by apps (e.g., phone backups to the cloud).

4. **Webmail Services**  
   - **What is it?** Email services you use through a web browser (e.g., Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Hotmail).  
   - **Syndication Services**: Tools like RSS feeds that send you updates or summaries of new content.
