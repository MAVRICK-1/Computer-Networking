### üìò **Easy Definitions (with a little more explanation)**

1. **Population**
  A population is the complete group of people , objects and  events . we wanted to study or lean about . It is the set of all data we want
  Example : Population of all the students in India

2. **sample**
   A sample is the small part of Population where we collect Data fron, Because it is difficult , costly and impossible to  get data from entire population
   Example 200 students from Each cities

3 **Statistical Inference**
   Statistic  Inference means using the data from the sample to make estimate , prediction and decision of the population .
   It help us to draw conclustion without studing evey single member of the population

4 **Statistic Model**
   A statistic Model is the mathemetical formuale or rules that helps us to understand relationship  between two variables. It is help us to understand pattern and Predict the future
   Example ‚≠ê A model tells us if you study more hours you will get more marks

5 **Probability Distribution**
   It tells us how likely a event woula occure ifw e do thoing randomely
   It helps to understand common and rare event 
   Example If we through dice The probabilty of getting 1,2,4 and 6 is 1/6

6 **Fitinng Model** 
   Fittimg MOdel means try to make the model closely to the data as we can.
   It give us the easy way to understand data and give precise prediction

7 **R programming Language**
    R is a programming Language and Software used for analysis of data ,
    Data Scientist use R to perform Calcultion , Create Graphs and use for data analysis
